      <p>In Boston's public schools, the numbers tell a story of change—and contradiction. Over the past five years,
        classrooms have grown more diverse, with Latino students now making up nearly 20% of the student body and
        multiracial identities on the rise. Yet, beneath these shifts lies a troubling reality: the systems meant to
        educate these students remain rooted in inequities. While diversity increases, resources and opportunities are
        still distributed unevenly, leaving many students of color behind.</p>

      <h2>Demographic Shifts: A Tapestry Unraveling</h2>
      <p>Over five years, Boston's schools have transformed into a demographic kaleidoscope:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Latino students, now nearly 1 in 5 learners, form the fastest-growing group—a quiet revolution in a district
          once dominated by White enrollment.</li>
        <li>White student populations have receded like the tide (65.77% to 62.45%), mirroring a city where rising
          housing costs displace working-class families.</li>
        <li>Multiracial identities bloom (3.85% to 4.43%), a generation rejecting boxes, yet still graded by systems
          built for binaries.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>But diversity alone isn't equity. Like mismatched puzzle pieces, these shifts clash with structures built for a
        different era: Consider Jeremiah E. Burke High School in Dorchester, where Black and Latino students comprise
        82% of the enrollment. A recent district report showed that 34% of teachers at Burke lack certification in the
        subjects they teach. Meanwhile, just a few miles across the city, Boston Latin School—an exam school that skews
        more White and Asian—offers nearly 30 Advanced Placement courses and benefits from robust alumni funding. Such
        disparities echo what many families already suspect: diversity within the district, absent the resources to
        support it, is little more than an empty gesture.</p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <p>"To call this a 'diversity success story' ignores the calculus of injustice: how a Latina student in East
          Boston is half as likely to reach calculus as her White counterpart in Beacon Hill."</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The Ghosts in the Data: Where Students Disappear</h2>
      <p>COVID-19 left scars the dataset can't hide. Enrollment dips in 2021-22 whisper of families fractured by
        evictions, students lost to childcare deserts, or teens funneled into gig work. Yet the steepest declines haunt
        higher grades:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>9th to 12th grade retention rates for Black students lag 11% behind their White peers—a chasm where college
          dreams fall through.</li>
        <li>Special education classrooms, disproportionately filled with Latino and African American boys, echo with the
          quiet bias of referrals: a 2019 state audit found schools in low-income areas are 3x more likely to label
          behavioral struggles as "disabilities."</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Resource Roulette: The Lottery No Parent Wants</h2>
      <p>In Boston, your ZIP code is your curriculum. At the Burke High School (82% Black/Latino), 34% of teachers are
        uncertified in their subjects. Ten miles away, Newton South High (71% White/Asian) offers 28 AP courses—triple
        the Burke's tally. The data screams what communities already know: diversity without investment is theater.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion: Rewriting the Algorithm</h2>
      <p>Boston's classrooms are alive with change, but the system's bones creak under the weight of old prejudices. To
        call this a "diversity success story" ignores the calculus of injustice: how a Latina student in East Boston is
        half as likely to reach calculus as her White counterpart in Beacon Hill.</p>

      <p>The numbers are more than trends—they're tombstones for potential. Yet buried in the data lies a blueprint:
        targeted funding for ESL programs, mentorship pipelines for students of color, and audits of disciplinary
        practices. Boston's schools don't need more diversity; they need a revolution.</p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>Our goal in crafting this article was to bridge the gap between raw data and human stories, transforming
        numbers into narratives that demand action. Inspired by the works of Nikole Hannah-Jones, whose investigative
        journalism on school segregation exposes systemic inequities, we aimed to weave data with lived experiences.
        Similarly, Ta-Nehisi Coates' ability to blend historical context with personal reflection influenced our
        approach, pushing us to ask not just what the data shows, but why it matters. By grounding statistics in the
        realities of students and families, we sought to create a piece that resonates emotionally while remaining
        rooted in evidence—a call to see education not as a system, but as a story of lives in balance.</p>

      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>This project analyzes enrollment data from Boston Public Schools from 2019-2024, exploring the relationships
        between demographic changes, resource allocation, and student outcomes. The visualizations and analysis aim to
        highlight systemic inequities within the educational system and advocate for more equitable distribution of
        resources across neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>Data sources include official enrollment statistics from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and
