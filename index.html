      <p>In Massachusetts' public schools, the numbers tell a story of change—and contradiction. Over the past five
        years, classrooms have transformed into a richly diverse mosaic, with Latino students now making up nearly 20%
        of the student body and
        multiracial identities on the rise. Yet, beneath these shifts lies a troubling reality: the systems meant to
        educate these students remain rooted in inequities. While diversity increases, resources and opportunities
        continue to follow historical patterns of privilege, leaving many students of color navigating an uneven
        landscape.</p>

          <h3>Demographic Trend (2019–2024)</h3>
          <div id="line-chart"></div>
        </div>
      </section>
      <p>Over five years, Massachusetts' schools have undergone remarkable transformation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Latino students, now nearly 1 in 5 learners, form the fastest-growing group—a significant evolution in a
          state
          once dominated by White enrollment.</li>
        <li>White student populations have gradually decreased (65.77% to 62.45%), coinciding with a region where rising
          housing costs reshape neighborhood demographics.</li>
        <li>Multiracial identities have increased steadily (3.85% to 4.43%), reflecting a generation increasingly
          comfortable
          with complex identity expression.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>But diversity alone doesn't create equity. These demographic shifts exist within structures designed for a
        different
        era—creating friction between who fills the classrooms and how those classrooms are resourced.</p>

      <div class="highlight">

      </div>

      <h2>Resource Disparities: Data Revealing Two Massachusetts</h2>
      <p>Consider Jeremiah E. Burke High School in Dorchester, where Black and Latino students comprise 82% of the enrollment. 
        District data shows that 34% of teachers at Burke lack certification in the subjects they teach. 
        Meanwhile, just a few miles across the city, <span class="highlight-district" data-district="Boston">Boston</span> 
        Latin School—an exam school with higher percentages of White and Asian students—offers nearly 30 Advanced Placement courses 
        and benefits from robust alumni funding.</p>

      <p>Such disparities illuminate what many families already experience: diversity within the state, without
        equitable resource allocation, cannot deliver equal opportunity.</p>

      <h2>The Patterns in the Data: Where Students Disappear</h2>
      <p>COVID-19 created disruptions that appear in the enrollment figures. The data shows notable dips in 2021-22,
        particularly affecting certain communities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>9th to 12th grade retention rates for Black students lag 11% behind their White peers—a significant gap in
          pathways to higher education.</li>
        <li>Special education classrooms show disproportionate representation of Latino and African American boys.</li>
        <li>A 2019 state assessment found schools in lower-income areas are three times more likely to classify
          behavioral challenges as disabilities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Geographic Determinism: Education by Zip Code</h2>
      <p>In Massachusetts, a student's ZIP code significantly influences their educational trajectory and opportunities.
        The Massachusetts Public Schools has developed an "Opportunity Index" that confirms what many families already
        know - neighborhood determines educational resources. The Opportunity Index identifies schools with higher
        concentrations of students needing additional resources to overcome opportunity gaps, examining both
        neighborhood-based factors and student-specific measures.</p>

      <div id="opportunity-viz-container" class="visualization">
        <!-- Visualization will be inserted here by JavaScript -->
      </div>

      <p>The contrast is stark: at Jeremiah E. Burke High School in Dorchester, where Black and Latino students comprise
        82% of enrollment, district data shows that 34% of teachers lack certification in their subjects. Meanwhile,
        exam schools like Boston Latin School—with significantly higher percentages of white and Asian students—offer
        approximately 30 Advanced Placement courses and receive substantial alumni funding.</p>

      <p>This educational inequity parallels broader neighborhood disparities. The median household income in parts of
        Roxbury is $42,211, compared to $141,250 in certain Back Bay census tracts. Additionally, 91% of Back Bay adult
        residents hold college degrees, versus just 44% in Roxbury. These socioeconomic differences directly impact
        school resources, course offerings, teacher qualifications, and ultimately student outcomes.</p>

      <p>The Massachusetts Public Schools system has attempted to address these disparities through various initiatives,
        including a controversial ZIP code-based admissions policy for exam schools introduced in 2021. Under this
        policy, neighborhoods with predominantly Black and Hispanic populations were projected to gain more seats at
        prestigious exam schools, while areas with more white and Asian students would lose seats. Such policies
        represent attempts to counteract the effects of neighborhood segregation on educational opportunity, though they
        remain contentious.</p>

      <p>These geographic inequities create measurable differences in academic outcomes, including college preparation
        and career readiness, demonstrating how a Massachusetts student's address often predetermines their educational
        possibilities.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion: Beyond Diversity Toward Equity</h2>
      <p>Massachusetts' classrooms reflect remarkable demographic evolution, but the system's structures struggle to
        adapt to these changes. To describe this merely as a "diversity success story" overlooks the persistent
        inequities: how a student in East Boston faces significantly different educational opportunities than a peer in
        Beacon Hill.</p>

      <p>The numbers reveal both challenges and possibilities. Targeted investment in multilingual education programs,
        mentorship initiatives for students of color, and systematic review of resource allocation could transform these
        statistics into action. Massachusetts' schools don't just need demographic diversity—they need structural
        transformation that ensures every student, regardless of zip code or racial background, receives an education
        that fulfills public education's fundamental promise.</p>
